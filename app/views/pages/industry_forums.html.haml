  %h1 Call for Industry Forums & Industry Track Papers

  %p The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. The industry program of ICME 2018 will bring together participants from academia and industry in a venue that highlights practical and real-world aspects of multimedia-related research. Geared toward facilitating collaborations between industrial and academic members of the multimedia community, the industry program aims to organize a series of industry talks, demos, panel discussions, and technical papers detailing industrial research activities relevant to the scope of ICME.

  %h3 Call for Industry Forums
  %p Industry leaders are invited to propose and lead Industry Forums. The format is open and could include industry talks, demos and/or panel discussions. Topics are expected to cover timely and interesting, or even controversial issues in all areas of multimedia, including but not limited to, emerging applications or standards, industry trends, technical breakthroughs, user needs, and social aspects. The industry forum would provide a platform for participants to discuss recent technological advances and innovations, and/or their vision for the next 5~10 years in multimedia. A 1-page description of the proposed Industry Forum should be submitted by the deadline to the Industry Program Chairs as outlined below. Technical papers and/or other related material may be optionally submitted to accepted industry forums following the guidelines for Industry Track papers below. Other supplemental materials such as presentation slides (up to 10MB) may also be submitted for inclusion in the USB proceedings.
