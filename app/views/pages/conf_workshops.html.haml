				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Overview
				%p The 3D community continues to innovate and evolve, with greater focus on enabling augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR/MR) experiences. There have been amazing breakthroughs on the capture and acquisition in recent years, with the introduction of microlens camera arrays and the growing momentum behind large-scale multi-camera arrays, as well as 360-degree video and depth sensing devices. Display technology continues to advance as the emergence of head-mounted displays gain in popularity. The widespread increase in computational power has allowed an ever-increasing realism in 3D scene generation. Additionally, 3D audio has the potential to add to the immersive experience through surround sound and realistic sound field rendering.

				%p While appropriate venues for presenting research at advanced stages are plentiful, the 3D multimedia community needs an appropriate venue for receiving feedback during early or initial stages of the development of radical and potentially disruptive technologies. This is the void that Hot3D tries to fill.

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Scope & Format
				%p Papers in all areas of Multimedia 3D are solicited. Early stage or preliminary results from potentially disruptive technology is particularly encouraged. Full papers (up to 6 pages) will be published in the ICME 2018 proceedings. 

				%p Additionally, and most importantly, position papers are solicited for short presentation and discussion of preliminary work or ideas. Submit a proposal of up to 2 pages, with a decision expected 2 weeks after submission. 

				%p The 1-day workshop will be co-located with ICME, the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies. The workshop will be a unique opportunity to interact with other researchers working on 3D Multimedia. With an environment designed to facilitate discussion and feedback in early stage research, as well as forge new collaboration, this is an event not to be missed.

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Overview
				%p The widespread reach of media has extended beyond movies and ads to internet-based platforms that share user-generated images and videos. While automated analysis is indispensable for traditional multimedia areas i.e. navigating, indexing and organizing diverse and vast media databases, more recently, an emerging trend in this area has been to improve and facilitate personal and social activities, insight generation, and interaction experience. Research effort has been directed towards developing computational tools and methodologies for systematic study of trends and biases in commercially produced media forms, such as movies. Yet another emerging area involves studying the impact of such content on the end users.

				%p One of the major research challenges in this area is that at the core of reliable analytics lie reliable algorithms. These algorithms must be robust under a diverse set of synthesized yet seemingly realistic background conditions. Depending on the type of media, these conditions could manifest themselves in the audio or video channels and could even vary within the duration of the content, thereby making it challenging to apply off-the-shelf techniques from other domains. Analysis of such content necessitates the design and training of customized algorithms that seek to exploit specific properties of or additional structure in the data. Infact, for most vision or audio related tasks, produced media data proves to be one of the most difficult benchmarks. This issue is further compounded by absence of any large in-domain datasets with reliable annotations.

				%p As a result, research in this field often requires a mix of clever data mining techniques and approaches from semi-supervised or transfer learning. Finally, this research area is also becoming exceedingly multi-disciplinary requiring skills from a variety of fields including engineering, film studies, psychology and social sciences. Thus the main purpose of this workshop is to facilitate conversation between different groups of researchers and provide a platform where they can share progress and updates in recent research on media analytics for societal trends.

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Call for Papers
				%p 
					The workshop will offer a timely dissemination of research updates to benefit the academic and industry researchers and professionals working in the fields ranging from multimedia computing, multimodal signal processing to social science. To this end, we solicit original research papers related (but not limited) to the topics listed below:
					%ul
						%li Media analytics and methodologies for all forms of media.(e.g. automated discovery of rich analytics related to gender, profession, ethnicity, personality, stereotypes, topics of discussion/conversation, and analysis of their interrelationships, dynamics and evolution over time.)
						%li Impact prediction and analysis (e.g. popularity, virality, memorability, commercial success and influence of media content on society)
						%li Methodologies and analytics for analyzing relatively less-studied media, such as, advertisements and animated movies.
						%li Affect and sentiment analysis from media (e.g. emotional appeal, persuasiveness, emotion perception and communication)
						%li Large-scale data collection, benchmarking and challenges.
						%li Evaluation protocols and metrics for methods analyzing societal trends.

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Submission Instructions

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Overview
				%p We have witnessed remarkable advances in facial recognition technologies over the past a few years due to the rapid development of deep learning and large-scale, labeled facial image collections. As progress continues to push renown facial recognition databases nearly to saturation. There is a need for evermore challenging image and video collections, to solve emerging problems in the fields of faces and multimedia.

				%p In parallel to conventional face recognition, research is done to automatically understand social media content. To gain such an understand, the following capabilities must be satisfied: face tracking (e.g., facial expression analysis, face detection), face characterization (e.g., behavioral understanding, emotion recognition), facial characteristic analysis (e.g., gait, age, gender and ethnicity recognition), group understanding via social cues (e.g., kinship, non-blood relationships, personality), and visual sentiment analysis (e.g., temperament, arrangement). The ability to create effective models for visual certainty has significant value in both the scientific communities and the commercial market, with applications that span topics of human-computer interaction, social media analytics, video indexing, visual surveillance, and Internet vision.

				%p This workshop serves a forum for researchers to review the recent progress of recognition, analysis and modeling of faces in multimedia. Special interests will be given to visual kin and non-kin social relations. The workshop will include up to two keynotes, along with peer-reviewed papers (oral and poster). Original high-quality contributions are solicited on the topics listed in the section below.

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Topics
				%ul
					%li Soft biometrics and profiling of faces: age, gender, ethnicity, personality, kinship, occupation, and beauty ranking;
					%li Deep learning practice for social face problems with ambiguity including kinship
					verification, family recognition and retrieval;
					%li Understanding of the familial features from vast amount of social media data;
					%li Discovery of the social groups from faces and the context;
					%li Mining social face relations through metadata as well as visual information;
					%li Tracking and extraction and analysis of face models captured by mobile devices;
					%li Face recognition in low-quality or low-resolution video or images;
					%li Novel mathematical models and algorithms, sensors and modalities for face &amp;
					body gesture and action representation;
					%li Analysis and recognition for cross-domain social media;
					%li Novel social applications involving detection, tracking &amp; recognition of faces;

				%h4{class: 'specsess-heading'} Overview
				%p Biometrics based recognition, identification and retrieval techniques become more and more important in our society. Great progress has been made in this area, focusing on heterogeneous cues (face, body (2D appearance and 3D volume), other unimodal biometrics such as finger and palm, gait, behavioral cues in general) which do not require user’s collaboration. However, this problem is far from being completely solved, particularly in real-world applications under uncontrolled environments, where a large number of factors hinder the identification/recognition/retrieval performance, including lighting variations, different types of occlusion, large pose evaluation and view change etc.

				%p The mission of the workshop is to explore the cutting-edge research in non-collaborative (re)identification/recognition/retrieval, with a particular emphasis on the fusion of different modalities under cross-view setting. For example, the face recognition and the re-identification communities, even though they share many objectives, they rarely have interacted to hybridize novel recognition applications, where both the biometric patterns face and body can be jointly exploited. This holds true also for the communities of gait recognition and body re-identification, thermal body recognition, visual body recognition and other biometrics cues such as Iris Recognition at a distance. The workshop, in this sense, will be highly interdisciplinary, encouraging papers (even preliminary), where the modality fusion plays a primary role.

				%p In addition, human-related identification/recognition/retrieval techniques greatly rely on the development of feature and similarity learning strategy. Therefore, this workshop also aims to explore recent progress in feature and similarity learning (distance metric learning) for biometric based identification/recognition/retrieval. It has been observed in recent years that the (re-)identification identification/recognition/retrieval performance can be largely improved when a robust feature representation or an appropriate distance/similarity function have been learned. In this aspect, this workshop will help the community to better understand the challenges and opportunities of feature and similarity learning techniques and their applications to (re-)identification for the next few years. In addition, with the great increasing number of data, the techniques addressing the large- scale biometrics are also extremely required.
