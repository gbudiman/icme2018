	Henrik Christensen is the director of the Contextual Robotics Institute and a professor of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. Prior to San Diego he was the director of robotics at Georgia Tech (2006-2016). Prior to this he was a professor of computer science at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology 1998-2006. He was also the director of the Swedish Center for Autonomous Systems 1996-2006. During the same period he was the founder and coordinator of the European Network of Excellence in Robotics, which involved more than 190 universities and companies across all European member states. He was an associate professor of robotics and computer vision at Aalborg University 1992-1996. Henrik I Christensen received his first degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical College of Frederikshavn, 1981. He subsequently worked at MAN B&W on control systems designs. He earned M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Aalborg University, Denmark 1987 and 1989, respectively.

%p
	Dr. Christensen does research on a systems approach to sensor-based robotics. The research must have a solid theoretical foundation, an efficient implementation and be evaluated in realistic contexts. Consequently, the emphasis is on “real systems for real applications”. The research has been published in more than 350 contributions across robotics, computer vision and artificial intelligence. The research has been recognized by numerous awards including best paper awards, the Joseph Engelberger Award (the highest honor by the robotics industry), and the Boeing Supplier of the Year Award 2011. He received an honorary doctorate from Aalborg University 2015. Dr. Christensen was the coordinator of the formulation of the US National Roadmaps for Robotics 2009, 2013 and 2016. The roadmaps were presented to the US Congress. He has graduated 29 PhD students and more than 60 M.Sc. students that today occupy positions at universities and companies across 3 continents. 

%p 
	Dr. Christensen is the co-founder of five companies and he currently serves on the board of Blue-Ocean Robotics and Robo Global. He also serves as a consultant to a number of companies and agencies across 3 continents.

%h2 Keynote Title: Human-centered Media Informatics
%h4 Shrikanth Narayanan (IEEE/AAAS/ASA/ISCA/NAI Fellow)
%h4 Niki & C. L. Max Nikias Chair, University of Southern California, USA
%h4 Time: TBA
%h4 Abstract:
%p
	The explosion in the creation and dissemination of media content in different forms and through different platforms, and the richness and variety therein, has created a huge	need for computational technologies not just to support access and interaction with content but in creating tools for objectively understanding, and predicting, the impact of content on people, both individuals and society at large. These include content produced more formally for entertainment, commerce and news as well as user-generated ones. The reach of media today is global, and its impact is as diverse and heterogeneous as the content.

%p 
	Advances in data sciences, notably in machine learning and human-driven computing such as crowd based methods-- as well as the converging trends between computing and social and behavioral sciences-- are enabling rich media content analytics of what stories are being told, and how they are being told including their affective aspects and are beginning to illuminate objectively their potential socio-emotional and decision making impact on people.

%p
	This talk will focus on the opportunities and advances in human-centered mediainformatics drawing examples from media for entertainment (e.g., movies) and commerce (e.g., advertisements). It will highlight multimodal processing of audio, video and text streams and other metadata associated with the content creation to provide insights into the semantic and emotional aspects including any potential human-centered trends and patterns such as unconscious biases along dimensions such as gender, race and age, as well as associated social and commercial impact relatable to content.
